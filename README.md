   Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
	- Overall this project was about creating a item tracking program for a corner grocer. This program would record listed items that were purchased
	  in chronological order. This program also reflected how many times the items were purchased. The program prompts the user to input an item and 
	  in doing so it will give feedback on that given item regarding how many times it was purchased and where in the item ordered list it was purchased.
    
  What did you do particularly well?
  - I think I did well creating the displayMenu. I was easy to understand and construct in my head.
   
    Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
	- I think I could have declared the functions a little better. I was initially struggling with trying to create each one and properly
	  properly coding them to be called upon. I believe this would help tremendously in the future with creating more functions and understanding how
	  they fit into the picture.

     Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?
	- I was initially struggling with trying to create each one and properly coding them to be called upon. I referred to my readings
	  as well as w3schools.com to get the proper format in order to write the functions properly.

     What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?
	- Since the project gave me a rough time it has taught me the valuable lesson of referring to websites dedicated to programming languages.
	  not to mention this project will help me structure my future projects more appropriately.

     How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
	- In order to create readable, maintainable, and adaptable code I made sure to add in line comments on what I was doing as well as using them
	  to set reminders to where I left off, so I wouldnt get confused or lost if I stepped away for a bit. This was important because I didnt want
	  to create unecessary code for the wrong things.
